            Argentina started their tournament with a 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia, ending their 36-game unbeaten streak, and many were stunned and thought they were lost. 
            However led by Lionel Messi's long range goal, Argentina beat rivals Mexico 2-0 and followed this with another 2-0 win against Poland. Ending the group in first place.
            Then, in the round of 16, Argentina found themselves facing Australia and cruised to a 2-1 victory. They then found themselves facing off against heated rivals, the Netherlands.
            Despite a chaotic game, Argentina led the match by 2 goals after some Messi brilliance. But, somehow, at the end of regulation time, it was 2-2 and despite the extra time, neither get the breakthrough.
            The match went to penalties and Argentina won 4-2 in penalties. Finally in the semi-finals, Argentina now had the task of beating the 2018 runners up, Croatia. Argentina led by Lionel Messi. Croatia led by
            Luka Modric, this was a rematch from their 2018 encounter. However this time, following a Messi penalty, a solo effort by Julian Alvarez, and a brilliant solo assist by Messi for Alvarez's second
            saw Argentina win the match 3-0 this time around. Argentina now have the difficult task of facing the powerhouse and reigning world champs, France.

            France started the world cup as the defending world champions and one of the heavy favorites of the tournament. France started the tournment with an easy 4-1 win against Austrailia. With Mbappe striking twice, France once again 
            cruised to victory with a 2-1 win against Denmark. With progression guaranteed, France decided to rotate players in their final group stage match, which ended with them losing 0-1 against Tunisia.
            Despite this, they still ended as the top of their group and matched up against Poland in the round of 16. France overcame Poland with ease, with goals coming from Giroud and Mbappe. In the Quarter Finals, France then came up against old rivals, and other heavy favorites,
            England. After a tense game, with a long range rocket from Aurelien Tchouameni, and crucial penalty for England missed by Harry Kane, France ended the game with a 2-1 win. They were finally in the semi-finals and now
            faced the "dark horses" of the tournament, Morocco. After upsetting both Spain and Portugal in the previous rounds, Morocco had captured the hearts of people around the world. But, this was not enough to beat this French superteam as France won the match 
            2-0. France now found themselves in their second consecutive world cup final, facing the champions of South America, Argentina.

            Argentina entered the tournament with a 36-match unbeaten streak, the second highest ever, and after ending their 28 year trophy drought in 2021 by securing the Copa America, 
            Argentina were looking to add a World Cup medal to their impressive form. Argentina have won the world cup twice before, in 1978 and 1986. Led by Lionel Messi, 
            they reached the final in 2014 but narrowily failed to win. After this, they went on too lose 2 consecutive Copa America finals, in 2015 & 2016. In the previous world cup, Argentina were
            knocked out by none other than France, and the team was looking for revenge. Once again led by arguably the greatest of all time, Lionel Messi. Following his first international title in 2021,
            Messi was looking to add more to his impressive resume and this time for Argentina.

            France entered the tournament in mediocre form compared to their standards. But with their status as defending champions, and their impressive team & roster, France were still one of the favorites to win. 
            France had won the World cup twice before, in 1998 and in 2018. France reached the finals of the Euro 2016 before losing to Portugal and were knocked in the round of 16 in Euro 2020, so they 
            were looking to add another world cup to their resume. Led by Kylian Mbappe, this team of experienced veterans, winners, and young talent were looking to secure their second consecutive World Cup title. 
            Their manager, Didier Deschamps, was looking to become the third person to win three world cup titles. The only thing in France's way? Argentina

        <p>
            While on the surface this game was Argentina vs. France, it was more than that. For Argentina, it was revenge and a chance at redemption. 
            For France, it was another chance at glory and an oppurtunity to go down as one of the greatest national teams of all time. It was also Lionel
            Messi vs. Kylian Mbappe, teammates and friends; it was the greatest of all time vs. the best player currently.
